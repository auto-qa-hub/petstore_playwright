# Test Plan for Swagger Petstore API

## Introduction
This document describes the test plan for automated testing of the PetStore API. The goal of testing is to verify
the correctness of the main endpoints and their compliance with the documentation.
The tests will be implemented using Playwright.

## Test Approach
The testing approach for the PetStore API focuses on verifying that the API aligns with its documented specifications and consistently performs as expected under different conditions.

## Test Types
Functional Testing: Verify that each API endpoint works as expected, including correct CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). 
Boundary Testing: Test edge cases to ensure the API handles inputs at the extremes (e.g., large data sets, maximum and minimum field values).
Error Handling: Test both positive and negative scenarios, in case the server is designed to handle negative scenarios.

## Risk & Mitigation
- **API Instability**

**Risk**: The Pet Store API may experience downtime or unexpected behavior during testing, leading to test failures or delays.

**Mitigation**: Monitor the API's status and schedule tests during off-peak hours.

- **Incomplete Test Data**

**Risk**: Insufficient test data may result in incomplete test coverage. Without proper data, some scenarios, especially edge cases, may be missed.

**Mitigation**: Develop a well-rounded dataset that includes both positive and negative test cases. This should cover normal use cases and edge conditions.

## Entry Criteria
- API documentation is available and up-to-date.
- Test environment is set up and accessible.
- Test data is prepared and covers key scenarios.
- Playwright is configured.
- API is stable for testing.

## Exit Criteria
- All planned test cases have been executed.
- Test results have been reviewed.
